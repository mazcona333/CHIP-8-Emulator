# CHIP-8-Emulator

My first emulating project. Devloped following [this tutorial](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/).

For compilling download [SDL2-devel-2.24.0-VC.zip](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.24.0) and extract it. Then in CMakeLists.txt set SDL2_DIR to the path containing sdl2-config.cmake.
